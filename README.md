# Pandas Data Analysis and Visualization Projects

This repository contains a collection of Python data analysis exercises using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `matplotlib`. It covers a diverse range of topics, including demographics, sports statistics, weather patterns, restaurant sales, historical events, and social trends. Each exercise is designed to improve your data wrangling, analysis, and visualization skills.

## Notebook

- **`problemset3.ipynb`**  
  Contains 10 question-based exercises that demonstrate practical use of pandas and matplotlib for data analysis. Topics include:

### Exercises Overview

1. **Occupational Demographics**
   - Analyzes a user dataset to explore age, gender ratios, and occupation-based groupings.

2. **Euro 2012 Football Stats**
   - Filters, sorts, and analyzes football team stats to find performance trends.

3. **Housing Dataset Simulation**
   - Uses random generation to simulate housing data and manipulate it using `pandas`.

4. **Wind Statistics**
   - Analyzes weather data (`wind.txt`) to find trends, missing values, and perform time-based aggregation (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly).

5. **Chipotle Sales Data**
   - Loads real Chipotle orders from a public dataset and explores revenues, order patterns, and most frequently ordered items.

6. **U.S. Marriages and Divorces Over Time**
   - Visualizes per capita marriage and divorce trends from 1867 to 2014.

7. **Comparative Marriage/Divorce Rates in 1900, 1950, and 2000**
   - Uses a grouped bar plot to compare marriage and divorce rates for selected years.

8. **Hollywood’s Deadliest Actors**
   - Creates a horizontal bar chart showing kill counts by actors from action movies.

9. **Roman Emperor Death Analysis**
   - Visualizes how many Roman emperors were assassinated versus dying from other causes using a pie chart.

10. **Arcade Revenue vs CS PhDs**
   - Plots a scatter chart to examine the strange correlation between U.S. arcade revenue and computer science doctorates awarded (2000–2009).

## Datasets Included

- `actor_kill_counts.csv`  
- `arcade-revenue-vs-cs-doctorates.csv`  
- `roman-emperor-reigns.csv`
